This is a **demo portfolio website** for testing GitHub Pages deployment and learning basic web development workflows.

I'm just playing around with ideas right now — layout, pages, animations, design, etc.  
The content, images, and details here are **not final**. I’ll update everything properly once I’m ready to build the actual personal portfolio.

## 🔧 What's the Plan?

- Replace dummy content with real projects
- Polish the layout and responsiveness
- Add blog system + ML projects
- Fully brand it as **Asif Marwat's** official site

For now, just exploring & experimenting.
